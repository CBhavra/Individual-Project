## Introduction

Cricket is an old but well-loved sport. It is played in many different countries and climates and has many forms some long (lasting whole days) and some small (lasting  only a few hours). It, like many other sports is comprised of two teams. One team tries to take **wickets** while the other team tries to score **runs**. 
There are many **Teams** (and types of teams), **players** and **statistics** to record as that is just the nature of the sport. So a cricket fan would enjoy the ability to view, input, update or remove team or player statistics.
